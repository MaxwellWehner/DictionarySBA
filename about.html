                <td>Solving puzzles has always been a passion and programing is a series of puzzles. I love to be stumped and trudge through a problem and see the other side. This gives me my passion to become a software engineer and see myself grow. Building projects and seeing them grow from nothing to a full app is another wonder of this profession and is amazing ever time. To build these dynamic web applications I have experience with the JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS and various other frameworks like React / Redux.</td>

It utilized these three technologies to interface with a free API <a href="https://dictionaryapi.dev/" target="_blank">dictionaryapi</a> in order to create a dictionary app. The API sends back information on the user’s word in the form of JSON and then it’s ingested by the site and displayed on the word page.</td>
